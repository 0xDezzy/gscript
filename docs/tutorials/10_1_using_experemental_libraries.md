# Using Experemental Libraries
The experemental libraries are less stable than the stadard libraries and often only support a subset cases. Becauses they are not cross platform and well tested, but often still crtitical to the mission of gscript we have included them in the official gscript project but as an experimental ibrary. This is often the best place to get new library commands added, and new commands will often live in experimental for awhile before moving to the standard lib by popular demand. 

## Windows Examples
Full examples of the experemental lib can be seen here, these ones are Windows specific:

Using registry functions:

https://github.com/ahhh/gscripts/blob/master/attack/windows/enable_smbv1.gs

Using process injection:
Need an example for this, but the functions are here:
