# Auditing Other gscripts


## Use a Javascript Linter

Configure your preferred text editor/IDE with a Javascript linter to parse `.gs` files for quickly spotting syntax errors.

## Build and Test Scripts Individually

Building individual scripts with their associated assets against their target platforms is a recommended way to see if the native libraries and script will even build.

## Sandbox/Automated Testing

Automating test builds of individual gscripts will identify build errors with the scripts at runtime.
