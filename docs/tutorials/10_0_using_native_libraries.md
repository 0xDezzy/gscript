# Using Native Libraries

The native libraries are designed to be helper functions that save the casual gscript writer from needing to interact with go docs. Using go native libs is the prefered way to write gscripts with gscript 1.0.0, however we have included to the native lib to help people write less code and make gscript easier. 

## Examples

Full examples of the standard lib can be seen here, there are also cross platform:
